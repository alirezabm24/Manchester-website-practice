            <span class="bold" id="Club">Club news:</span> The transfer gossip
            columns will link Manchester United with dozens of new signings
            before deadline day, but the reality is that any new signings remain
            highly unlikely. At his press conference on Friday, Erik ten Hag
            addressed the probability of signing another striker on loan and all
            but ended speculation of any arrivals this month.

            boss Lee Carsley has turned down the opportunity to become the next
            senior Republic of Ireland manager; Carsley was on Ireland's
            shortlist of candidates to replace Stephen Kenny; he won 40 caps for
            Republic of Ireland from 1997-2008

            <span class="bold" id="Coaches">Coaches news:</span> Just imagine if
            United did sack Ten Hag and they replaced him with the man who
            crashed and burned so spectacularly at Chelsea. Potter has plenty of
            mitigation â€“ it is hard to imagine anyone succeeding at Stamford
            Bridge last season, but the ex-Brighton manager needs to
            re-establish his credentials for the top jobs elsewhere before being
            considered by the biggest clubs again.

            With facebook Manchester United midfielder Mason Mount has been
            pictured in the Carrington gym, working diligently as he continues
            to recover from injury.

            <span class="bold" id="Staff">Staff news:</span> The club's head of
            sports medicine, Gary O'Driscoll, has led a review of the medical
            department with the support of manager Erik ten Hag and Sir Jim
            Ratcliffe. This has resulted in a member of the physio team leaving
            the first team set-up as United aim to enhance all aspects of the
            club (via the Mirror).
